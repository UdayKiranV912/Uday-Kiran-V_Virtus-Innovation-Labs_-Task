## Build a game using React-three libraries like Fiber, Drei, Rapier, or any other react-three library. 

The game should feature a vehicle with the following characteristics:
1. The vehicle should have 3 wheels and joints.
2. The front wheel should be a sphere, and the back wheels should be small cylinders.
3. The body of the vehicle should be rectangular.

### Game Mechanics:
1. The car should move in the direction you point the cursor when you press "W" and should move backward when you press "S". The cursor should help you take turns.
2. To make the game more fun, we'll randomly drop different shapes (cubes, spheres, pyramids) from the sky. These shapes will have different masses and sizes, and you need to program this randomness.
3. Your goal is to escape the falling shapes to survive. If you touch any of the shapes, the game will be over.
The falling shapes should exhibit physic properties when they hit the ground.

### 3Bonus:
1. Store the score in a Supabase database at the end of the game.
2. Use Tailwind CSS to make it adaptable to mobile and tablets.
